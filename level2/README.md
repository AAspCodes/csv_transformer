# Level 1

- Intended as a simple example of how you could structure your csv transformmer
- I may add a level 2, for a much more capable and configurable csv transformer, but can't promise the interest will last that long.


## How to run
- open pycharm in the level 1 directory
- run the line below in your terminal ( the $ means to run it in your terminal)
> $ python main.py

# Or
- open pycharm in csv_transformer directory
- run the line below
> $ python level1/main.py
